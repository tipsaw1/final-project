            Offset is set to the players position - half the screen, meaning that
            As the player moves left, the offset decreases .
            
            ex: player position of 0 = offset value of -half the screen
            
            The sprites position is then subtracted by the offset, meaning the farther
            left the player goes, the farther right the sprite is drawn and vice versa
            
            The player is also affected by this, meaning that it cancels out their
            position and places them in the center of the screen
            
            ex: player position of 0 - offset value of -half the screen
             = player position of half the screen (2 negatives cancel out)
             
             The Rects remain in the same position relative to each other,
             allowing you to use collisions and other pygame Rect features
